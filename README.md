# Sutro Tower Coat Rack

A coat rack of SF's sutro tower


I wanted a coat rack which looks like Sutro tower in San Francisco! Everyone from San Francisco will know that the Golden Gate Bridge is for tourists, the real symbol of The City is Sutro Tower, a radio tower on the highest hill in the city which is visible from almost every neighborhood. Out of nostalgia for The City and a genuine need for a coat rack I built a scale model of the tower this week to hold my hat.

Here you can see it in use:

Here's a picture of the real life sutro tower:

This coat rack was one of the first things I made and I would really like to revisit it because I think I could design it better now.
