Assembly is pretty much self explanitory. The three side parts attach to the center shelves with screws through the edges.

Pre-drilling the holes is a good idea to prevent the plywood from splitting. Because the screws go into the shelves the length of screw is not critical.

This was one of the first things I designed and I neglected to add dog bones to the corners so the rounded corners will need to be cleaned up with a file.
